HimalayanHuts is a platform where people can easily search for rooms, flats, and housing rentals in different areas of Nepal.

## Introduction

In the world of Computer Science, we often seek solutions to real-world problems. Today, we're addressing a significant issue in Nepal—a country known for its beauty but also for the difficulties people face when trying to find a place to live.

Our goal is simple: We're creating a platform to make it easier for people to find rooms, apartments, and houses to rent in Nepal. This is especially important because many students, migrants, and tourists come here, but finding a good place to live can be tough.

In Nepal, there are unique challenges when it comes to renting a place. For landlords, it’s difficult to find a suitable tenant, and for tenants, it’s hard to find a vacant place to rent. While there are big platforms like apartments.com and Zillow in the US, there are no such websites that target the Nepalese audience. Currently, most landlords either put a “To Let” sign in front of their house or use Facebook groups to advertise their properties. This is really inefficient for everyone. We are creating this platform to make this process much easier.

Our vision is to give people a tool that makes finding a place to live in Nepal simple and stress-free. We want to connect those looking for a place to live with the available rental properties. By doing this, we hope to help solve Nepal's rental problems.
